1. DeepLearning_Strategy.py file contains code for return class prediction on a rolling basis using one hot encoding, which uses High-Frequency Orderbook features over a period of 40 days, with Training Testing split as 80:20

2. DeepLearningMINMAX.py file contains code that uses LSTM RNN for Financial Price series prediction.The algorithm does not perform training on a rolling basis unlike DeepLearning_STrategy.py

3. DeepLearningOneHotEncode.py file contains code that uses LSTM RNN for price return class prediction using one hot encoding.The algorithm does not perform training on a rolling basis unlike DeepLearning_STrategy.py
   
4. Refer file "LSTM_Presentation_Final.pdf" for sample Strategy Implementation details
